## Provoc:sunny:
An alarm app for iOS and Android that donates your money to charity if you fail complete a warm up challenge in an alloted amount of time after the alarm goes off.

## Motivation 
As I wake up I usually have a period of unproductivity in which I'm lounging around in bed, on my phone, and just generally in a very distracted mindset. This project is an attempt at improving the classic alarm clock to get your brain warmed up for work as soon as you wake up, at the threat of financial loss. I'm also using this project to learn react native and to apply my current mobile development skills to a new idea that I'm interested in.
